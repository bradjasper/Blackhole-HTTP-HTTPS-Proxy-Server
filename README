# Blackhole HTTP/HTTPS Proxy Server

This is a blackhole proxy server written in Python that kills any request and optionally serves a custom message instead of a website.

## Why would you need this?

This is an important piece of <a href="http://www.heyfocus.com/">Focus</a>, a Mac app that blocks distracting websites.

## How does it work?

Rather than implement a full HTTP proxy server, this just returns an HTTP response. For HTTPS it just drops the connection, but you can optionally do some insecure stuff to intercept them too.
